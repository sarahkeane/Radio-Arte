Thanks to them, she grew up between two cities named St. Louis, one in Missouri, and the other, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The sounds of Beat Latino are infused with a multi-culti Latino perspective, going back to classic recordings as well as looking ahead to emerging sounds, styles, and performers. &iexcl;Viva la m&uacute;sica latina en toda su diversidad, desde sus ra&iacute;ces hasta la vanguardia!
